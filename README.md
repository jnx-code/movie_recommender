## 📌 Project Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** suggests movies to users based on their preferences using **Machine Learning** and **NLP techniques**. It provides personalized recommendations using a **Streamlit web interface** for an interactive experience.  

This project uses:
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to a selected movie based on descriptions, genres, etc.
- **Collaborative Filtering** *(optional)*: Recommends movies based on user behavior and ratings (if dataset available).

## ✨ Features  
- 🎥 **Search Movie**: Select a movie and get top recommended movies instantly  
- 🧠 **ML/NLP Models**: Uses TF-IDF / Cosine Similarity for recommendations  
- ⚡ **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for real-time interaction  
- 📊 **Visualizations**: Optional charts for rating distribution and genres

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Prepare the Dataset

Download the MovieLens dataset or any movie dataset.

Place it inside the data/ folder.

4️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app/movie_recommender.py


Open the link shown in your terminal to access the web interface.

🎯 How It Works

Data Preprocessing: Clean movie titles, genres, and descriptions.

Feature Extraction: Use TF-IDF vectorization for text features like overview, genres.

Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity between movies.

Recommendation Engine: Suggest top N similar movies to the user-selected movie.

UI Interaction: Streamlit provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time recommendations.

📈 Future Enhancements

Add Collaborative Filtering using ratings matrix

Deploy on Heroku / AWS / Render for public use

Integrate real-time movie database APIs (e.g., TMDb) for dynamic updates
